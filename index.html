                <p>My name is Arthur Arnaud I am 22 years old. I was born in Paris but left when I was only 2 years old. Since then, I've been living in Lausanne. I am therefore both French and Swiss.</p> 
                <p>After highschool, to many subjects interested me so I went to EHL because those studies were the one that left the most doors open. I will graduate EHL this year.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies🎨</h2>
                <p>Renovating old furniture or trinkets from flea markets is my hobby because it allows me to unleash my creativity, find satisfaction in restoring neglected items, and learn new skills like woodworking and engraving.</p>

                <p>It's also environmentally friendly, cost-effective, fosters a sense of nostalgia, and provides a social outlet where I can connect with other enthusiasts and share tips and inspiration, making it a fulfilling and multifaceted pastime.</p>
